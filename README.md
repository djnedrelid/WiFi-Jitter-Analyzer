Mainly created to test gaming setups for a stable flow of packets when logged into a massive online 
world where things happen in real-time and there's no time for buffering. A steady stream of packets 
is ultra important for all real-time online experiences and is without a doubt best covered by a 
physical connection, but this isn't always available, so it can be very useful to test your wireless quality. 
Packet loss is less important for recorded streaming services like YT, Netflix, etc. that can be buffered. 
But you want a good score for video chatting, online gaming, etc.
